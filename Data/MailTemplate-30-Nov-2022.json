The entire WonderBiz community is working remotely as we navigate the COVID-19 global health crisis together.

So you will need to do some coding on it.\r\nKindly recheck your Webcam, Mic (Headphones), and Audio (Speaker) of your Laptop / Desktop before you start the interview.

They are the foundation of who we are and how we support each other and our clients. The people you'll be meeting with are looking for candidates who can demonstrate these values. You'll also want to prepare a list of questions for each person you're meeting with to better evaluate if this is a good fit for you.\r\n\r\nVisit Us: www.wonderbizglobal.com\r\nLinkedIn:\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/wonderbiz-technologies\r\nAlso if you can give Quick Feedback before your Interview:\r\nhttps://forms.gle/AvKx169SDUsxztRE9\r\n\r\nThanks, and good luck with your interview!",
